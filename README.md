<h2>About Me</h2>

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Danielle O'Connell and I'm an aspiring data analyst with a background in education. <br/>
<br/>
My journey into data began during my education at the University of Southern Maine. In the Elementary Education program, I learned to collect, interpret, and utilize student data to inform instructional strategies. <br/>
<br/>
During my recidency in a first-grade classroom, I worked with data to design structured lesson plans and educational interventions, aiming to increase student success. This hands-on experience allowed me to develop skills in data literacy, critical-thinking, problem-solving, and evidence-based decision making. These are all skills that transfer naturally into the world of data.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to leverage my skills to pursue a career existing at the intersection of education and data. My passion lies within mathematics, lifelong learning, and using data to create meaningful change in the world. I look forward to connecting with professionas and creating projects that reflect my career goals while showcasing my growth as a data professional.
